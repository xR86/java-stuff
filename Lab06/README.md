### Lab description

**Drawing Graphs of Functions**  

Create a Swing or JavaFX application that allows drawing graphs of functions.

![function graph](http://mathonweb.com/help_ebook/html/functions_3/fungraph03.gif)

+ Specify a *function* of one variable in the real domain as a string expression and draw its graph. 
Any function should be permitted: linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal etc., for example: `f(x)=sin(x)` or `f(x)=x^2 + 2x + 1`, etc. 
You may use a third party library for parsing and evaluating expressions, such as **exp4j** or **Apache Commons JEXL** or other.
+ Plot several points on the surface and draw the graph of the *polynomial function* passing through the given coordinates. You may use the *Lagrange polynomials* or other interpolation technique.
+ Both axes of the coordinate system should be displayed, along with *texts* marking various elements such as O, X, Y, etc.
+ When representing a function the user must be able to specify the *colour* of the drawing and the *stroke*. Multiple graphs of functions may overlap in the same drawing, unless the user decides to "reset" the view.
+ Save/Load the drawing in/from a JPG of PNG file, using `javax.imageio.ImageIO`.
+ You may also encode the drawing using **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. Check out The **Apache Batik Project**.
+ Implement the application using **JavaFX**.
